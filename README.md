# Team Organisation

This repo is for organising the work between different parts of the parity tech stack. The goal is efficient self-organisation.

* There should be one issue for each "major" project that Parity is working on.
* Each team should have people assigned to it that are working on that project, please self-assign and move yourself if you switch project.
* Each project should have an owner.

## The role of the Owner

The owner of a project bears the responsibility of that project overall,
but it doesn't necessarily mean that they do anything different than other people on that project.

For instance, for efficient communication in the company, if I have a question on Kovan and I'm wondering who to talk to,
I could go to the Kovan project and look up the owner and ask the question. The owner doesn't necessarily have to answer that question
but is ultimately responsible for that it gets answered.

## Labels

Each project can have one of two labels `help wanted` and `over-subscribed`.
`help wanted` means that there's room for more people to join the project.
`over-subscribed` means that the project has too many people working on it and someone should try to move themselves
to a different project.

Labels should ideally be managed by the owner of the project and possibly have some oversight by Gavin.
